# Amath-523-Term-Paper
This repository contains the scripts developed for the term paper of the class AMATH 523: Mathematical Analysis in Biology and Medicine at the University of Washington.
Here we simulate a stochastic trajectory implementing the Gillespie Algorithm for the Ross-MacDonald model for vector-borne infections, as well as solving it as a system of ODEs.
